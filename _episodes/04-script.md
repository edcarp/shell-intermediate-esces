title: "Shell Scripts"
teaching: 30
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I save and re-use commands?"
objectives:
- "Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files."
- "Run a shell script from the command line."
- "Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line."
- "Create pipelines that include shell scripts you, and others, have written."
keypoints:
- "Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use."
- "`bash [filename]` runs the commands saved in a file."
- "`$@` refers to all of a shell script's command-line arguments."
- "`$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc."
- "Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them."
- "Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands."

We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.
We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files
so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.
For historical reasons,
a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a **shell script**,
but make no mistake:
these are actually small programs.

Not only will writing shell scripts make your work faster ---
you won't have to retype the same commands over and over again ---
it will also make it more accurate (fewer chances for typos) and more reproducible.
If you come back to your work later (or if someone else finds your work and wants to build on it)
you will be able to reproduce the same results simply by running your script,
rather than having to remember or retype a long list of commands.

For this example, we'll agin use the `exercise-data/populations` directory containing population time series for six species, from the Living Planet Database of the [Living Planet Index](https://www.livingplanetindex.org/data_portal).

Let's start by going back to `populations/` and creating a new file, `middle.sh`, which will
become our shell script. Use `cd` if required, to change to this directory, then `pwd` to check you
are in the right directory. Then:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The command `nano middle.sh` opens the file `middle.sh` within the text editor 'nano'
(which runs within the shell).
If the file does not exist, it will be created.
We can use the text editor to directly edit the file -- we'll simply insert the following line:

~~~
head -n 10 shark.txt | tail -n 2
~~~
{: .source}

This is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier:
it selects lines 9-10 of the file `shark.txt`.
Remember, we are *not* running it as a command just yet:
we are putting the commands in a file.

Then we save the file (`Ctrl-O` in nano),
 and exit the text editor (`Ctrl-X` in nano).
Check that the directory `populations` now contains a file called `middle.sh`.

Once we have saved the file,
we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.
Our shell is called `bash`, so we run the following command:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Sure enough,
our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.

What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
We could edit `middle.sh` each time to change the filename,
but that would probably take longer than typing the command out again
in the shell and executing it with a new file name.
Instead, let's edit `middle.sh` and make it more versatile:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now, within "nano", replace the text `shark.txt` with the special variable called `$1`:

~~~
head -n 10 "$1" | tail -n 2
~~~
{: .source}

Inside a shell script,
`$1` means 'the first filename (or other argument) on the command line'.
We can now run our script like this:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh shark.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Currently, we need to edit `middle.sh` each time we want to adjust the range of
lines that is returned.
Let's fix that by configuring our script to instead use three command-line arguments.
Each additional argument that we
provide will be accessible via the special variables `$1`, `$2`, `$3`,
which refer to the first, second, third command-line arguments, respectively.

Knowing this, we can use additional arguments to define the range of lines to
be passed to `head` and `tail` respectively:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
~~~
{: .source}

We can now run:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh shark.txt 10 2
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This works,
but it may take the next person who reads `middle.sh` a moment to figure out what it does.
We can improve our script by adding some **comments** at the top:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
~~~
{: .source}

A comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments,
but they're invaluable for helping people (including your future self) understand and use scripts.
The only caveat is that each time you modify the script,
you should check that the comment is still accurate:
an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.

What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?
For example, if we want to sort our `.txt` files by length, we would type:

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n
~~~
{: .language-bash}

because `wc -l` lists the number of lines in the files
(recall that `wc` stands for 'word count', adding the `-l` option means 'count lines' instead)
and `sort -n` sorts things numerically.
We could put this in a file,
but then it would only ever sort a list of `.txt` files in the current directory.
If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,
we need a way to get all those names into the script.
We can't use `$1`, `$2`, and so on
because we don't know how many files there are.
Instead, we use the special variable `$@`,
which means,
'All of the command-line arguments to the shell script'.
We also should put `$@` inside double-quotes
to handle the case of arguments containing spaces
(`"$@"` is special syntax and is equivalent to `"$1"` `"$2"` ...).

Here's an example:

~~~
$ nano sorted.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# Sort files by their length.
# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames
wc -l "$@" | sort -n
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
$ bash sorted.sh *.txt ../numbers.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
    1 python.txt
    3 bowerbird.txt
    4 wildcat.txt
    5 ../numbers.txt
   11 dunnock.txt
   18 shark.txt
   20 toad.txt

Suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful --- for example,
that created a graph we'd like to use in a paper.
We'd like to be able to re-create the graph later if we need to,
so we want to save the commands in a file.
Instead of typing them in again
(and potentially getting them wrong)
we can do this:

~~~
$ history | tail -n 5 > redo-figure-3.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Depending on which commands we have typed recently, the file `redo-figure-3.sh` might now contain:

~~~
297 bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
298 bash goodiff.sh stats-NENE01729B.txt /data/validated/01729.txt > 01729-differences.txt
299 cut -d ',' -f 2-3 01729-differences.txt > 01729-time-series.txt
300 ygraph --format scatter --color bw --borders none 01729-time-series.txt figure-3.png
301 history | tail -n 5 > redo-figure-3.sh
~~~
{: .source}

After a moment's work in an editor to remove the serial numbers on the commands,
and to remove the final line where we called the `history` command,
we have a completely accurate record of how we created that figure.

In practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times
to make sure they're doing the right thing,
then saving them in a file for re-use.
This style of work allows people to recycle
what they discover about their data and their workflow with one call to `history`
and a bit of editing to clean up the output
and save it as a shell script.
